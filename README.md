# 7-Segment-Display-implementation-using-the-8086-Microprocessor
The Intel 8086 Microprocessor is a very important piece of hardware that can be used in implementing many ideas , it gives the engineer a good understanding of how to use many types of memory , how to use peripherals which also gives them a taste of how an actual computer might operate

# Project Overview
The Intel 8086 Microprocessor is a foundational piece of hardware, offering insight into memory usage, peripheral control, and the core functions of computer operation. This project highlights the following:

Address Pin Functionality: Detailed explanation of address pins used in MINIMUM mode, allowing effective memory and I/O operations.
Timer Implementation: A practical example of a 60-second timer using the Intel 8086, complete with required memory components, latches, and peripherals.
System Diagram: Includes a block diagram that maps out the system structure, as well as a memory map sketch for a clear view of memory management.
Screenshots: Visuals of the actual setup are provided to enhance understanding.
# Key Features
In-depth Address Pin Analysis: Understand how address pins function in minimum mode for effective hardware control.
Memory and Hardware Integration: Explore the types of memory and hardware required to support the timer, offering a hands-on approach to learning microprocessor-based design.
Documentation: Comprehensive report with diagrams and screenshots to guide learners through the 8086â€™s operation and timer implementation.
